Create class, SimpleSpice.
Let the class be a property with a String for the name of the spice, and a String for the level of spiciness.
Set the name to curry and the spiciness to mild.
Using a string for spiciness is nice for users, but not useful for calculations. Add a heat property to your class with a getter that returns a numeric value for spiciness. Use a value of 5 for mild.
Create an instance of SimpleSpice and print out its name and heat.
